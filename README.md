#Python Code for Detection of Lane Lines in an Image
Before, we get started, Iâ€™ll share with you the full code you need to perform lane detection in an image. The two programs below are all you need to detect lane lines in an image.
You need to make sure that you save both programs below, edge_detection.py and lane.py in the same directory as the image.
edge_detection.py will be a collection of methods that helps isolate lane line edges and lane lines. 
lane.py is where we will implement a Lane class that represents a lane on a road or highway.
